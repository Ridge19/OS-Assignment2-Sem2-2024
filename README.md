How to run the program:
-----------------------------
- to make compilation easier, we have included a makefile, thus compiliation of the program 
is done by the command *make*.
- to execute the program, in terminal type *./bestfit* or *./firstfit*
- to remove the executable files created, type *make clean*

program infomration 
-----------------------------
when make is typed, it creates two executables *firstfit* and *bestfit*, using main.c with each file having its own implementation (firstfit and bestfit implementation)
